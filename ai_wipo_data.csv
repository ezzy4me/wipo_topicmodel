2.02221E+11,AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED HELMET FOR ACCIDENT DETECTION AND NOTIFICATION,25.11.2022,"ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION Accidents caused by road hazards are more likely to happen when riding a bike. Potholes, sewer grates, railroad and trolley lines, and other road hazards are the ones most likely to result in bicycle accidents. Due to the obvious reasons that they have less surrounding safety than four-wheelers like vehicles, bikers are the most accident-prone individuals when it comes to suffering significant death injuries. Once he has his hands on his ride, every rider should be cautious, observant, and think that a traffic collision should be the very last thing that might happen to him and his ride. The frequency of accidents is increasing as there are more 2-wheeled motor vehicles on the road. Most fatalities happen either because the person wasn't wearing a helmet or because they were. To get around this, this invention suggests a smart helmet for preventing accidents and warning the wearer before an accident occurs. Alcohol/Gas sensor (MQ5) built into the helmet can determine whether the rider is intoxicated. In order to locate the rider and contact the closest emergency service in the event of an accident, the GSM and GPS have been incorporated to our project. Alcohol sensors can detect the presence of alcohol on a rider's breath. If the motor speed surpasses 100 km/h, an LED will flash. uses a cardiac pulse sensor to check the state of the human body (Heart Beat). The helmet has sensors that sense the environment and send signals to a microcontroller, such as an Arduino Board, to check the conditions. The RF module has a reception unit at the bike and a transmitter unit at the helmet where data is wirelessly transmitted. The two-wheeler battery or an external battery can supply the necessary energy for operation. The bike's buzzer alerts the other riders to the rider's aberrant condition if their heart rate increases or decreases while they are operating it. The rider's head and the cruiser's speed are determined separately by a Force Sensing Resistor (FSR) and a BLDC Fan. When an accident due to high speed is imminent, it will send the wearer an alert. This concept will help India develop in a safer and more secure manner. Just one step forward for the culture that requires smart helmet use while operating a motorcycle.",IN,A42B /,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=A42B%20/&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These types of the electric locomotives get their benefits from the high efficiency of the electric motors often above the better efficiency of 90%. Adding up to it give the additional efficiency which can be gained from the regenerative braking which allows the kinetic energy to be recovered from the braking system. When the brakes are applied the energy spent in braking is recovered and feed into the motors for the better additional efficiency. The Electrical, Mechanical and Thermal parameters of a train are of a very great importance in bringing into judgment whether the said train is running smoothly and with stability. As the electric locomotives are is quiet when compared to the diesel engines as there is no engine there is no exhaust of noise and mechanical noise.

Cognitive abilities and memory in Alzheimer's sufferers deteriorate with time. Recent studies have shown that people with Alzheimer's disease have elevated inflammatory markers, suggesting that inflammation plays a significant role in the onset and progression of the disease. Microglial receptors CD14, CD36, and CD47, and TLRs, may all be able to detect AÃŸ oligomers and fibrils. The neurodegenerative process begins when AÃŸ binds to either CD36 or TLR4, setting off an inflammatory cascade of chemokines and cytokines. TLR4 has been implicated in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease as of late. Several diabetes-related clinical problems, as well as changes in the body's internal environment and the brain's microenvironment, have been connected to TLR4 activation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that TLR4 inhibitors not only decrease the likelihood of getting sick but also increase life expectancy. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics modelling were used to examine the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs against the TLR4 receptor. Parlodel's primary interactions were anticipated with the help of molecular docking investigations. With a binding affinity of -9.6 kcal/mol, it was the most promising of the candidates. The interaction pattern between Parlodel and the TLR4 receptor was verified by running a molecular dynamic simulation at a time scale of 50 nanoseconds. By making substantial contact with the active site, Parlodel ensured the complex's structural integrity was maintained throughout its rapid expansion. In light of these findings, further research into Parlodel's potential as a lead drug for TLR4 receptors is warranted.Accompanied Drawing [FIG. 1] [FIG. 2] [FIG. 3]",IN,G01N /,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=G01N%20/&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many people overlook or dismiss the benefits of motorised two-wheelers for people who are unable to travel by foot or public transportation due to concerns about pollution, noise, road safety, and driver behaviour. As a result of these social and political issues, cycling is widely regarded as a viable mode of transportation, even though it is best for short distances. The ""sustainable mobility"" paradigm helps to frame discussions about the potential role of electric two-wheelers (pedelecs, electric mopeds, and electric scooters) in urban vehicle ecosystems. Traditional transportation planning does not place the same emphasis on accessibility, people, streets as physical spaces, city livability, or the environment as this new approach does. This new way of thinking has undergone dramatic changes. The researchers examined academic and policy literature, as well as alternative modes of transportation such as motorised and pedalled vehicles, public transportation, and private automobiles, to determine what they could accomplish for this study. It demonstrates the differences in transportation systems between the three countries through the use of an example from each. Additionally, electric two-wheelers are being discussed as potential policy tools to aid in their spread. Two-wheel electric vehicles are critical for transportation, sustainable development, and climate change mitigation.

2.02141E+11,FOURIER PTYCHOGRAPHY BASED EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER,26.11.2021,"This project proposes a low-cost Fourier Ptychography based early detection of lung cancer as a replacement for expensive microscopes. Fourier Ptychography (FP), a simple computational microscopy technique that provides high-resolution images at a cheaper rate, reveals the innermost hidden details of cellular data and provides valuable information for medical professionals. The large mortality rate in the case of lung cancer when compared to other cancer forms is due to the unavailability of a proper early detection framework. Sputum cytology is a non-invasive technique for lung cancer detection. One of the significant problems associated with sputum cytology is the low space bandwidth product (SBP) of conventional microscopes. The traditional microscope imaging techniques can provide either high-resolution or wide field-of-view (FoV) but not both. So this project incorporates the FP technique in the conventional microscope to improve its SBP value and improve the resolution of the sputum image sample; thus, more features can be extracted from it. Artificially increasing the SBP of an imaging system by mechanical scanning methods is suboptimal, as it requires precise control over actuation, optical alignment, and motion tracking. Furthermore, the design and maintenance of complex mechanical systems are tedious as the control strategy to be used complex, making its initial and running cost comparatively higher for application in common laboratories. After applying FP technique to different specimen samples, the resolution has been enhanced 16 times and the Numerical Aperture (NA) has increased from 0.25 to 0.6, which proves that the SBP has been increased. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based model for extracting features from the reconstructed images of the sputum samples enables identifying Malignancy Associated Changes (MAC) for early detection of lung cancer.",IN,G02B /,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=G02B%20/&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2021104096,AN AI-BASED SYSTEM FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS,12.08.2021,"When it comes fulfilling the capacities of an individual in terms of psychological support and intervention the lag is evident. The huge stigma attached to the psychological issues/mental illnesses makes it all the more difficult for the population all over the world to go and approach the psychologists/psychiatrists. In addition to stigma, population is unaware of psychological signs/symptoms and emergency interventions related to psychiatric disorders. Henceforth, need of an artificial intelligence system which interacts with people about their psychological symptoms was seen. This is an inbuilt system based on Al which allows the user to express their needs and wants in a single platform. The application performs the functions from diagnosing to treating the user. Surely there are many unnoticed cases of mental illnesses which haven't been reported. The stigma attached to the mental illnesses makes it all the more difficult for the people to approach psychiatrists/therapists. This application will help the people to approach for treatment without facing any social stigma. Which in turn will help to develop a much transparent database for the same. The data base can be accessed by the Governmental Organisations to develop statistical data on the prevalence and occurrence of all psychological illnesses. Patients who are already under treatment can use the app for further interventions. Unlike other apps available in the market this app is completely Al based. How they feel, for how long are the symptoms running and further helps them track down their ongoing mental health conditions. The system will update/improve system based on latest researches and updates. The patient will be diagnosed according to their symptoms. The responses will be recorded and user will be suggested for further interventions. The recording of the response will further help in improving the quality of diagnoses. The sensors and camera of the laptop/ smart phones will be utilised to sense the emotions and vitals of the patient. The application will be connected to the smart watch also to configure the vitals of the users. Automated suggestions based on the present recorded condition of the user will pop up. For example, a pop up for breathing exercises, medicines. Time scheduled for therapies. Ongoing patients can enter their details and can continue with the treatment online. This in turn will help both the new and old patients to utilise the application. An approach to multiple health applications have been a part of the daily lives of the people. We have applications to talk to physicians, take appointment, applications taking care of our physical health have always been an emphasis.Apps taking care of our menstrual health, physical activities, diet planning, less is the area explored for mental illnesses/issues. An empty space was observed in the approach towards mental health. During the pandemic the lag was realisedon a greater wave length. When people were all locked inside their homes without an interaction with the outer world. When the population could not help themselves but be in the situation. It took months for the situations to normalise. Some might have had a good environment at home, some may not. Some might already be suffering from mental illnesses. Some might have been addicted to alcohol/drugs. Looking into the history of pandemics, we see that there was a rise of mental illnesses then and now with COVID-19. There have been reported rise in the cases of mental illnesses. People already suffering from the illnesses had no space to approach and contact psychiatrists. People who never had any symptom also gained anxiety and panic disorder as a result of the lockdown. Further the patients will get suggestions for virtual therapy and treatment sessions which they can go through from the same interface. Therapies earlier have been a separate part of the applications which either have been specified to anxiety and depression or just an app with therapies and consultations available. This invention will allow the user to go through the complete procedure at one go. The therapies again based on Al will be provided virtually. The application will register the timings and dosage of the drugs and therapies. The application will then buzz the user for their drug and therapy.Data will be gathered from the patient for the ongoing treatment and therapies or any other possible intervention that the patient is already going through or applied for the present psychological condition. The Al will take the feedback and suggest improvements on the ongoing interventions. The complete information will then be converted into a database which in turn will be utilised into the statistical information. This information can be processed into valuable data's that the organisations and governments can utilise for further interventional purposes. The prevalence of mental health issues in the community at all levels can be recognised easily. Since mental illnesses are associated with taboos in the society that people who earlier might be not in the count of the statistical data will now be part of the complete analysis of the data. The application will be helpful in taking out the real statistical data of the population. Usually, we only consider what is into account, and cannot go into the real data. People can easily be tracked and intervened for their condition. Early intervention can easily be possible for the suffering populations or the people who are unaware of the things. This application will in turn create awareness by giving health education tips and ideas for new and latest treatments for people.

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONOne of the most unexpected effects of the pandemic is the classical dance going the digital way. This process has thrown a challenge to re-design the conventional manner of teaching-learning and has felt the need to create the content of high quality in e-learning as we have to move to this realm in the performing arts sector which has felt the acute need of staying connected. This in turn will necessarily mean more technological stepping in for the online mode of learning. This work has attempted a very relevant and important area.The process of mudra recognition begins with generating a database for the five mudras Alapadmam, Thripathakam, Katakamukham, Kapitham &,Shikaram, which are bothnon-conflicting in nature,and also repeated usage of the same is found both in the basic steps and for miming the lyrics. A substantial study was undertaken to zero in on the most oft-repeated mudras and which are non-conflicting (Which are similar or look alike mudras). One of the primary objectives of this study is to generate datasets of mudras that have frequent usage and also because the training dataset in most cases is images collected through Google search engine. The mudras which are collected in such a manner are mostly web labeled rather than human-labeled which is not necessarily accurate as normally web search itself need not be accurate. The other reason for creating a dataset that is specific to these 5 mudras is that it can serve as a benchmark dataset for further research. A survey on literature relating to hand gestures reveals that not many publicly available video datasets in this specific area although there are literary works that are rich in sign language, hand gesture, etc. It is both an expensive and highly time-consuming process to generate accurate videos for specific mudras. Figure I shows the process involved in recognizing generic hand gesture recognition based on image processing techniques.A lot of effort has been taken in instructing how the hand mudra should be placed and captured with different backgrounds. Generation of data has been done by capturing data through the web camera and smartphones from different categories of people, untrained, beginners, and experts. The generation of specific data is been given high importance as existing data available consists of mostly static mudras in one particular angle whereas the need of the hour while conducting online classes there is a necessity for recognizing mudras when placed in different positions, therefore, capturing the hand movements as video. Instructions had been given to the manner of holding the finger in the correct position and moving it. This is done as it is essential to recognize the hand pose from different angles. Both the right hand and the left hand has been captured separately. Table I displays the mudras which have been focused on the proposed work.Normally either the glove-based approach or vision-based approach is used to capturing the images. While using armbands, helmets gloves, etc. certain difficulties arise on the restriction of movements, therefore, the choice for the vision-based approach was made which alleviates these problems and also the accessibility to inbuilt cameras used in smartphones and web camera in laptops which are economical. As visibility is important for recognition of the gesture how to place the hand at a certain distance from the camera, capture the video of the movement of the mudra within a limited time for both the right hand and left hand is informed well ahead to the participants. The area of the application lies both in the dance class and also in public spaces like the airport, railway stations to have a better reach of the art form to various sections of the society. Video is captured in different lighting and background and with the slow movement of the mudra so that at any point of the movement the algorithm should recognize the hand gesture whatever be the orientation of the mudra.The candidates are mostly from Nivedanam dance school Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, an Institute which trains students of both genders and different age groups. Care was taken to capture the video in normal rooms at different venues lit with fluorescent lights in a manner occlusion does not occur. Figure 2.1 shows the Alapadmam mudra and Figure 2.2 shows the Thripathakam Mudra, Figure 2.3.Katakamukham, Figure 2.4.Kapitham & Figure 2.5 Shikaram. In Total 75 video clips have been generated from 15 different people. It is pertinent to note that they belong to male and female genders for both right and left hand. Video frames acquired of the 5 different hand mudras namely Alapadmam, Thripathakam, Katakamukham, Kapitham & Shikaram of different orientations considered in this work are shown in in Table 2.Pre-processing and segmentationGenerally, it has been found that real-time data is neither highly accurate nor consistent. To overcome this issue, preprocessing steps become an absolute necessity. Preprocessing techniques are very crucial for better clarity of the image which in turn helps in accurate identification of hand gestures in general and mudras in particular. This work has used a simple bounding box of hand as preprocessing technique for segmentation of the object which here is the hand. Hand movements and poses can be detected in different ways. One of the simplest ways to obtain the Region of interest is to segment the foreground from the background and obtain the contour of the hand.CAW ??ArchitectureAs a general rule, it is seen CNN architectures generally belong to the supervised learning category where the input image is classified and the output label is predicted. The exchange of messages between interconnected artificial neurons is what the system of the convolutional neural network is about. These networks are state-of-the-art models for various image processing tasks like Image Classification, Segmentation, Object Detection, etc. There are many layers where each layer has neurons that respond to different inputs from the previous layers. The connections have numeric weights that are tuned during the training process so that a properly trained network will respond correctly when presented with an image or a pattern to recognize. The network consists of multiple layers of feature-detecting neurons. The process of extracting the features is done by the CNN and learning various features is an automatic process. Figure 4 shows how a typical Convolutional Neural Network has been applied and its internal functionalities are further discussed in [26].The four main layers Convolution, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), Pooling or Sub Sampling and Classification (Fully Connected Layer) each built in a manner that the first layer detects a set of primitive patterns in the input the detection of a pattern of patterns is done by the second layer the next layer detects the patterns of those patterns which goes on. The application area of CNN is largely in the image data which is a matrix of pixel values.In the problem statement, the images of the hand are to be cropped. This dataset consisting of the five mudras of the Asamyutha hasta of Bharthanatyam are used to train the pre-train model for detecting the gestures of the hand. Matlabfile(.mat) contains a collection of polygons given along the dataset to help to detect the hands. The points that make the edges of the hand are represented by polygons such as 'Own Left', 'Own Right', 'Other Left', and 'Other Right' that is contained in each image.In an image, there can be a maximum of 4 hands. Each polygon has 4 arrays consisting of the (x,y) coordinates of each "" point as a pre-processing step a box is drawn after finding min(x), min(y), max(x), max(y).Once every single image is processed it is changed to a Comma Separated Values(CSV) file. The dimension of the bounding rectangle is contained in the CSV file. Tensor flow is used to train for object detection. Conversion of CSV file to tfrecord format is done thereafter the pre-trained network is given the record file to detect an object with 5 different classes of mudras.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo classify the hand gesture CNN is used. The different mudras with different positions of fingers are trained using CNN model to represent the various gestures when the hand gesture is captured in real-time the image of the hand is cropped and is sent through the same CNN model where classification is done and the probability of each of the class is given as the output.This work is a two-pronged process [A] Offline training testing [B] Real-time testing, in the first process, the dataset is split into a train set of 80 percent and a test set of 20 percent folders and convert the dataset from .csv files to tfrecords. First train 80% of the data sets which have been captured either through web camera or through smartphones and 20% test freshly given videos of the 5 different mudras and find out their accuracy. The other is for real-time using the timestamp method when the video is captured through a web camera. The specified hand movements that are captured in real-time are from persons whose hand gestures are not trained before, against the already trained mudras. Real-time classification of dynamic mudras is highly demanding this being due to how the mudra is performed and the type of people whether they belong to trained, untrained, or experts in the area. The system should also effectuate apparently where there is significantly less time lag between performing the mudra and its classification. This paper addresses these issues and employs CNN-based methods MobileNet architecture to give good results. To validate the proposed method we corroborate with another CNN-based method Inception v3 and perceive that MobileNet Architecture displays a notably higher result even for offline testing.The network goes through the first step of forwarding propagation and there would be an output accurately assigned to the class. According to the class, the output probabilities are calculated using the weights which have been optimized to correctly classify all the previous training examples for a new image. It is seen when the training set is varied.in terms of illumination, background, gender, and age, and also the data set is fairly large the network generalizes well to new images and also classifies them into the correct categories. The classes of mudras are considered together and experiments are conducted on them.Table 3 shows results for offline testing Mobile net architecture for mudra database we get 80%- 90% average accuracy and elapsed time 177.19 sees. Table 4 shows Real-time testing MobileNet architecture for the mudra database we get 80%-85% average accuracy .172 seconds for one frame. Table 5 illustrates the comparison of various approaches to static /dynamic hand gesture recognition with the proposed hand mudra recognition. The accuracy varies due to the random element in the training process.From the analysis, it is found that our proposed work uses video clips, capturing only the hand mudra during movement which captures the perfect mudra. These mudras are captured from different kinds of people belonging to different categories untrained, beginners, and well-trained persons. Instructions as to how to hold and perform the particular mudra in front of the camera are given specifically to avoid misinterpretations. Each mudra refers to a class. This is done since our work is to be used towards various application areas and not restricted to one area. The research work is expected to be of value in activities such as promotional activities of performing arts, the domain of teaching-learning, and as benchmark datasets for further exploration in this specific research area.Table 5 Comparison of various approaches with proposed work The obtained results of our proposed work with 75 video clips where each clip is of different timing consisting of a total of 5500 selected frames for training and 1100 frames fresh images for testing are reasonable for the proposed hand mudra recognition scheme. It is seen that NeuralNetworks for some earlier work provide better results this can be attributed mainly due to the crucial rationale that datasets are mostly static poses either just for hand gestures or full-body poses based on keyframe identification whereas in the current work, the frames for the mudras have been chosen in a way that the dynamic nature of the mudra movement is considered and a large number of video clips have been created in comparison with earlier related works which mostly deal with static images of mudras. This work is of high consequence in the sphere of intangible arts of India. There are no similar works in publicly available datasets specific to these mudras pertaining to dynamic videos. Yet survey finds literary work is well-supplied in hand signs related images, therefore to make a comparative study Sebastien Marcel train and test images set for sign language is taken as shown in Table 6.The images found in Sebastien Marcel Static Hand Posture Database [23] are in the PNM format. It is a database containing about 10 persons with 6 hand postures (a, b, c, point, five, v), with thousands of Various images with both uniform and complex backgrounds. The window size for each posture are varied 20x20 for A, 18x20 for C and Five, and 18x30 for B, Point, and V (Figure 3). It achieves a good recognition rate for the comparison work. This CNN model when applied to Sebastien Marcel's benchmark database gives satisfactory recognition results. Table 7represents the results for offline testing Mobile net architecture for Marcel benchmark database which gives 85%-95% accuracy as an average and elapsed time 71.119secs for all the images on an average.To corroborate the results for the image dataset generated by us another deep learning technique based on CNN architecture-Inception network, which is a significant step forward in CNN classifiers is being applied. The difference between general CNNs and inception networks is that general CNN's convolution layers are stacked deeper to get better accuracy whereas the Inception network is complex and has used different techniques to enhance the performance. There are various versions of the Inception network each one being an improvement on the earlier version. Inceptionv3 being the default architecture provided by tensor flow is the natural choice for comparative purposes as it has good efficiency with the computational cost being reasonable.Table 8 shows results for offline testing applying Inception v3 architecture for Sebastian marcel dataset where we get 63% average accuracy and elapsed time 286.51 sees for the dataset consisting of 2000 static train images and 400 static test images. The results of applying Inception v3 classier on the mudra generated are shown in the current Table 9.The current CNN-MobileNet-based architecture diligent study indicates that the number of hands that are captured is adequate in comparison with other research work and it is found that the results are within an acceptable range for mobile net architecture, and elapsed time is significantly lesser compared with earlier work [3] and reasonable when compared with work [2], [4] being static images against our proposed dynamic images.It is important to note that the work [2] and [4] have also used only static images which explains reduced time for processing whereas the proposed work uses video clips with the orientation of the mudras beingdynamic iri nature. Hence, this can be considered as good performance. The comparison results for the time elapsed are shown in table 10.CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKSWhile the literature on hand gesture recognition is quite rich there are relatively few works on this specific topic, recognition of mudras in Indian classical dance forms. Therefore the proposed dataset can be used as a benchmark and can be seen as a great . opportunity for exploration in this particular research area..According to our comprehension, this is one of few works using transfer learning for mudra recognition in Bharathanatyam. The present work focuses on classifying Bharathanatyam mudras of Thripathakam and Alapadmam.Katakamukam, Kapitham, and Shikaram with their corresponding labels. Identifying the discriminant feature when it is a multiclass problem is a difficult task and it requires the knowledge of an expert. Here assistance by domain experts is taken to group the hand poses correctly for training. Vision-based real-time gesture recognition proposed using deep learning alleviates the problem of wearing difficulties.The proposed model achieves good performance on the Mudra Dataset, varying between 80% - 85%with real-time recognition speed and offline accuracy of 80%-90% with MobileNet architecture. As against another state of art methodology inception v3 classifier,it is observed that the MobileNet archttecturegivesa better result. The elapsed time on an average for processing one frame is .172 seconds which is good for dynamic mudras. It is seen that the performance is good irrespective of gender, skin color, variation in illumination, background, etc. The result is credible taking into account the number of challenges ' posed by object detection like orientation, background, location lighting. Ortce the hand is detected, we use CNN to classify the'' hand image to find out the corresponding class. There is sufficient scope in the area of classification to show better accuracy both for the single-hand gestures and extend it to double hand gestures ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nd also for those mudras which are conflicting similar in appearances. The next work should overcome occlusions that have induced bottleneck in recognition which could be attained by increasing the number of training sets and should be developed as a complete application.For future enhancement, the proposed mudra recognition system will be carrying out various real-time gesture patterns to both single hands and double hands. Thus, it would create interest for both aspirants who wish to leam Bharathanatyam and laypeople alike. Furthermore, there is a big installation of hasta-mudras (hand-symbols)in the airport of New Delhi the Capital of India. This recognition system placed next to this installation could attract the attention of national and international travelers. Hence, this concept can further be extended to other travel ports such as airports, railways, bus stations , etc. We also believe that such a mudra recognition system will elevate India to impact the world and reinforce its position as a soft power across the globe through the performing arts. 6.

2.01741E+11,SYSTEM FOR ADAPTIVE GUIDED AMPHIBIAN ROWING (SAGAR),17.08.2018,"The primary problem with amphibious aircraft is its performance degrading due to the adaptation for water operations. The conventional design of amphibious aircraft which include hull, floats, hydrofoil, sponsons, pontoons etc. will negatively impact the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft and also have stability issues, problems due to loading of wave slap, and problems with operation from sea other than calm state. This indicates a strong need of an innovative approach while adapting the aircraft for land and water operations.Hydrodynamic stability of ships and seaplanes or flying boat or amphibious aircraft depend on Weight (in air and water), Geometry, Centre of Gravity, Centre of Buoyancy, Metacentre and the restoring moment created thereby when disturbed from rest. Conventionally this is addressed by floats suitably sized and located along with the hull or the fuselage. While the floats are a proven way of handling the operations in water, the associated penalties in terms of weight, drag etc. are the areas wherein improvements can still be made. Without compromising the flying characteristics of a proven aircraft, meeting the requirements of operations in and out of water is challenging for the amphibious aircraft design. The amphibious aircraft needs to takeoff, land and dock in still and moving water bodies like sea, lakes, rivers etc. where the characteristics of the water body plays major role in the dynamics of the amphibian. Keeping these key aspects of operational requirements, the conceptual invention of a System for Adaptive Guided Amphibian Rowing (SAGAR), helps the amphibious aircraft to maintain its stability, augment its controllability and handling when in water. The concept uses a feedback controller which works on Artificial Intelligence technique such as Artificial Neural Network based adaptive reconfigurable control system taking into consideration of various parameters such as speed, sea state, wave height, etc. to manoeuvre the seaplane with adequate safety for passengers and freight. This system drives a retractable Rowing or paddle mechanism with actuators and associated sensors and will be located within the fuselage. The requirement of float or sponsons or pontoons is avoided by utilizing the benefits offered by SAGAR. This ensures that aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft are not affected much due to the adaptation for water operations. The SAGAR mechanism offers a scheme in order to improve hydrostatic stability, hydrodynamic stability, water performance, wave performance and also aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. The retractable/ rowing control surfaces of the SAGAR can aid in additional lift generation which would be beneficial to enhance STOL (short take-off and landing) performance of the aircraft on water as well as for land based applications. The SAGAR can be used in amphibious aircraft or seaplane or flying boat for optimum performance on water, land based runway, and in air. This concept can also be used in ships for enhanced water performance under different sea state conditions.",IN,B64C 35/00,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=B64C0035000000&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2953186,"MEANS, APPARATUS, AND METHOD FOR HUMANISTIC INTELLIGENCE, UNDIGITAL CYBORG CRAFT, AND SOUSVEILLANT SYSTEMS FOR MACHINE INTEGRITY",29.06.2018,"Advances in sensing technology, combined with AI
(Artificial Intelligence) have created devices and
systems that sense our every movement in intricate
detail. Society is evolving toward a world of surveillant
systems - - machines that sense us more intimately,
yet reveal less about their internal states and
functions. The modern ""user-friendly"" trend is to hide
functionality and machine state variables to ""simplify""
operation for end-users. While this ""dumbed down""
(and ""dumbing down"") technology trend is supported
by most of society, there is a risk that it undermines
the natural scientific curiosity and comprehensibility of
some end-users, leading them away from trying to
understand our technological world. Surveillant systems
work against users of intellect, excluding them from
particpating fully in technological progress, and
possibly driving some users away from logical thinking and
toward technopaganist ""witchcraft"" and insanity.
To reverse this harmful trend, Minsky, Kurzweil,
and Mann proposed the use of HI (Humanistic
Intelligence) to create a ""Society of Intelligent Veillance"".
Accordingly, Sousveillant Systems are systems that are
designed to reveal their internal states to end-users
intelligently, to complete an HI feedback loop. This paper
is in-part a kind of ""manifesto"" to (or at least
inspiration for) product designers, system designers, creators,
manufacturers, etc., on how to create better technology
that makes us smarter rather than stupider. Here is
disclosed a number of embodiments of an invention
related to the new emerging field of Sousveillant Systems.
The invention is based on technology that makes its
internal state apparent to the end user, without
appreciable delay or omission (""Feedback delayed is feedback
denied"").
In one embodiment, a Haptic Augmented Reality
Computer Aided Design system allows the user to
create content using a special kind of lock-in amplifier. In
another embodiment, the user's body, especially their
core (e.g. transversus abdominis, obliques, rectus
abdominis, erector spinae, etc.) facilitates a pointing device
or cursor, in the feedback loop of an interactive
computational process such as a game. This ""PlankPoint .TM.""
or ""CorePoint .TM."" technology gives rise to a new form
of fitness based on Integral Kinesiology such as
absement or absangle with respect to a target path or goal
trajectory through a multidimensional virtual reality or

supported to hold up the centre
(which can the tallest tower in the world) and tension cables can also support
the central tower (the
tension cables can serve two functions... as tension cables like a tent
strings that hold up the tall
structure the wires serve another purpose which is to provide zip lines
entertainment (with rentable
realtime video of the ride down for souvenirs).
One way to get to the top is to take a fully transparent gondola that travel
upwards (climbing the walls)
Â¨ possibly with a short magnetic levitation track - with at a slight angle
sideways so the gondola makes
at least one full circle (like the UK) ferry...people will get the chance to
see and take pictures of the
wide view 360 degrees like the London Eye or Eiffel tower (we may use visor
and sound guards so the
gondola users can see the outside view but not into the building windows).
At the top is revolving restaurant and observation deck.
To crown it all off is a very very very large telescope; during the night
people can see (in real time) the
planets, stars, any all heavenly bodies and during the day people can see (in
real time) the sun (with
protected safety from sunlight eye damage ie. with tint/visor lens and any
other ultraviolet damaging
spectrum protection... to see the sun's gases and plasma... in real time in

20110072573,SPA CONTROL SYSTEM WITH IMPROVED FLOW MONITORING,31.03.2011,"A spa control system that measures the flow of water through the heater and accurately reports water temperature in the spa using only one solid-state sensor in the heater. The working condition of the sensor is first determined by activating the heater for a brief period of time, with the circulation pump de-energized, and watching for the expected heat rise at the sensor. A small rise is sufficient to proceed with the flow test. The rate of flow is now determined by energizing the pump, with the heater still de-energized, and observing the rate in which the moving water cools the inside of the heater. If there is no circulation of water through the heater, the temperature of the sensor will continue to rise from the energy applied when the heater was briefly energized. This rise will be quite significant and a clear indication of a flow problem. If the flow is found to be adequate, the heater will be energized for a normal period of time. The sensor is now carefully monitored for a sudden increase in temperature, which would indicate loss of a normal flow of water. It is known that the temperature of the water in the spa will be within one or two degrees of the observed temperature in the heater, even when the heater is energized. The water temperature can, therefore, be accurately reported to the user just from measuring the temperature of the water in the heater. The only problem with making all measurements at the heater is that the real water temperature is unknown when the pump is not running. This problem can result in short heating cycles, or create the need to run the pump several times per day just to check on the real water temperature. The present invention uses artificial intelligence to find the difference between the heater temperature and the real water temperature and then applies the learned difference to the heater temperature measurement as an offset for the next heater and pump activation, where a new offset will be calculated.",US,E04H 4/00,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=E04H0004000000&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2010100092,GOAL SEEKING ADAPTIVE PATTERN PROCESSING ENGINE,11.02.2010,"This document describes an Engine which is designed to operate in changing real world environment. Engine can be described as a Black Box to be assigned a goal (see Figure 1). The Black Box operates in the World with which it interacts by recognising the World's current state and executing commands against the World. The World can react on commands by changing its current state or ignore commands and stay in the same state. The World also can change its state by own reasons which Black Box cannot understand and control. At some point World can start responding differently to commands issued by Black Box and Black Box must be intelligent enough to recognise this change and adapt own behaviour accordingly. Goal of this project is to eliminate as much as possible human involvement in programming of Engine's behaviour and let Engine to work out by itself how to achieve a goal by interacting with World by trials and errors. Properly constructed Engine is able to act autonomously. Its elements are autonomous modules working undependably and parallel to each other. Highly parallel architecture allows achieving breakthrough in speed and performance. Engine design can be as complex as required to handle given number of tasks and regardless complexity can be fast, robust, responding in a real time. Engine can be implemented as software or hardware solution or mix of both approaches which looks more promising up to date. Leading world CPU manufacturers are changing their strategies towards multicore computer processing architecture when a single CPU runs many parallel processes in the same time. This tendency will make engines similar to one described in this document very useful and highly demanded on the market. Nature of this engine makes it ideal where artificial intelligence is required. Decades ago artificial neural networks seemed to be appealing technology to achieve artificial intelligence but unfortunately they are still in their infancy, complex and difficult to implement. Engine described is aimed to bridge the gap and bring affordable artificial intelligence solution to everyday life. GG Figure 2.

We can also optionally send a secondary (or even 4 more) - simultaneously (just like the first quantum entanglement above) with the same information to the same place that we can, create a secondary communication whereby after much testing we could determine the shared parts (of the entanglement communications) that deteriorate given the distance, time apart and building blocks of input (eg. type of atom, electron, strength/stability of spin...and/or photons used) and the corresponding deterioration rate. For random errors the communications messages; from both 1. and 2. are overlaid to identify differences. 8. We could also create node relay networks including dividing the distance of major internet user (high density to high density) areas that break up the distance between long distant nodes into smaller distances by starting a new entanglement at each relay station... 9. We could also use satellite to cover the longer distances. 10. And also optionally a slower (fiber optic cables), secondary duplicate of the original communications message (that can be ordered by the Users at the other end if they find some of the communications message unclear and suspect many and large mistakes (whereby after much testing of quantum entanglement over the long distance required, we could determine the shared parts (of the entanglement communications) that deteriorate given the distance, time apart and building blocks of input (eg. type of atom, electron, strength/stability of spin...and/or photons used) and the corresponding deterioration rate (and the deterioration cannot be extrapolated; predicted, but rather is random and therefore cannot be cleaned up by clean up software/Artificial Intelligence/computer algorithm) - except in this case unlike 1. and 2. above; for 3. the medium of passage is by fiber optic cables (possibly with relays (An .3%)) which are slower but the communications message does not deteriorate. The purpose of the 3 step strategy above is that when speed is needed over long distances, (1. above) quantum entanglement can be used from which at the far end the receivers get the most of the communications message, and then if they suspect many errors can order a later communications via slower fiber optic for later more correct study without and file corruption and missing pieces. The fiber optic step might even be eliminated (redundant) if the receiver has an adequate (and based on expertise and the type/place/scale relative to document of information) that they are looking for suffices.",CA,G99Z 99/00,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=G99Z0099000000&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

television all
compatible with Artificial Intelligence.

We allow Users to view or Neural Links experience the rooms either facing
straight as a
human standing facing the room from normal perspective. And/or blueprint
overview of the
layout room by room or several rooms at once (Zoom).

The rooms can be anything from offices, waiting rooms, bedrooms, board rooms,
to city
walkways to wander University, any and all grounds and buildings, streets,
including fantastic
science fiction, fiction...

The rooms/compartments/neighbourhoods/districts/cities (based on typical
(usage GP)
and/or customized, could be furnished with plants, tables, zoomable Television
where
internet movies Hub or Movies Library and boardrooms equipped with
teleconference and
VOIP fax and phone International calling capabilities. Along with mimicking
the real world
environments the websites will come with downloads of data/papers/prototype
products ~
which are multidimensional (eg. 360 degree viewing and/or 4 sided + height and
weight). We
could also have environments such as space crafts, any and all environments,
including (pre
programmed and Artificial Intelligence characters as well as other Users)
holographics
rooms, eg. a multidimensional golf game where you can choose to play golf at
any popular
golf course in the world. (Smaller space shuttles as they travel GP20% through
space),
space stations/different planets, hover vehicles (eg. The 5th Element).

Computer and Electronic retailers could allow people to wander the
multidimensional
buildings where products are divided by type and usage (listing substitute
products), by price
and quality. Except in cases where there are no substitutes, one can search
via scroll
type/usage of product, namebrand and the complementary products and their
various model
numbers.

We could replace any and all websites to multidimensional websites (with our
own browsers).
Another example is plant/garden stores, plants a organized by varieties,
difficulty to maintain,
pictures of scanned plants at various ages (eg. seedling to flowering to fruit
to description of
taste of fruits to look as healthy leaves) and versions, click on the plant
for care needs eg.
differing needs based on season ~ fertilizer, soil, temperature, sunlight,
hardness, waterings
~ plants can also be sorted by indoors/outdoors, size).

We could also create our own multidimensional websites search engine. First
search by key
words names labels of entities (identities) and interactions. We could also
search by (label of
as above entities, interactions ~ identities in the picture ranked by
usage/uniqueness/importance to recognition ~ familiarity most associated)
representative
picture(s), context suggested by what can be seen by label of background GP,
environment)
in on the specific places/locations and time that leads to picture that

clues/attributes of each
or combinations starting with key words and the websites that have given the
known
information about clues/attributes and their gauge of certainty ~ are the most
popular based
on number of hits. We could also rank the known information.

We could also offer our websites for factory outlets.

One room could house the sale priced (popular goods) goods (the attention
grabbers), that
when pressed on for price shows all the complementary products that other
people who
pressed on the product also looked at and bought.

Or room for sales price from overstocked goods.

We could offer real time inventory updates that in stock left and pricing
changes.

We could put in a main room with aisles or divide by separate
rooms/compartments products
that are complementary and/or substitutes (niches like vegetables and fruits),
specialities
unique stocked products that stores nearby don't stock and their prices and
rate in real time
qualities ~ eg. freshness. Re: substitutes where one can scroll down rankings
by price
and/or popularity (turnover relative to other substitutes).

The website could offer web surfers seasonal spending habits.

We could also offer web surfers who expect to buy what and others who enjoyed
this product
also.

Another application is a layout of a conference, where member/subscribers
could wander
and click on booths (represented by people eg. behind booth table, and/or
pictures of
company logos...even the prizes they are giving away) to check through their
list and specs
of their products, even leaving a digital business card with that company's
booth. Products
can be sorted by (brandname) needs they cater to and their compatibility.

We could have fashion (any and all retail) walls (segments/sections) dedicated
to apparel
that appeals to client type (age, size ~ body type proportions), affordability
up to luxury. We
could have a number of these machines at every mall. It would take the
dimensions of a
person, the model dimensions would be sent to any retail store that the person
is interested
in apparel and if the person is serious about the apparel choice so as to
reserve or make a
refundable down payment, our tech person at the mall (with many model sizes
and
dimensions) could go to the retail store pick different (close sizes for
loos/tight/colour/print/pictures/logos) versions and bring them back to the
our tech outlet
trying rooms to put on the clothes on the model that most closely matches the
dimensions of
the person's body, and either video conference and/or take digital photographs
and/or real
time video to offer the buying experience by friendly, knowledgeable sales
representatives.
Any and all business uses including networking perusing products specs and
compatibilities...



Another technology converting real life objects from to multidimensional
computer/television
objects is to use Millimeter-Wave Imaging, backscatter X-ray.... We could
either pan
surround the object for 360 degrees and/or 4 sided object. Using this
technology the other
way around prototyping technology where the dimensions are recorded on a
computer
program and multiple robot sculpting arms (eg. car industry) makes a model
(dimensions eg.
changing width as we travel down the length of the car) out of clay by copying
expert
sculptors techniques/methods using large tools to clear away large swaths
making enough
room for protrusions (in case the y take away the protrusions), then finer
tools to get the
smaller definitions, by calculating the direction relative speed, how much up,
how much to
the right ore left or how much downwards. Diagonal and map out by real time
zoomable
pixelation view of the smaller curves (rate of change of directions). Adding
more clay if too
much is taken off (pressing in top centre of the new added clay and blending
so there is no
space between the new clay where its surface faces the surface of the
mistakenly over cut
part). We could also use these methods for stone sculpting (where the secret
seems to be
the grain where the wood should be split over/under or inbetween). And stone
sculpting
where the secret seems to be how much momentum (force behind hammer GP)
relative to
the width of the chisel based on the amount of (and grain) of the slate that
the chisel bangs
at on the stone.

We could also use Millimeter-Wave Imaging, Backscatter X-ray Imaging (varying
signal
strength depending on needs and what materials lies between the location of
examination
and how easily the x-rays can (penetrate by type of material(s) and
amount/depth blocking
the x-ray view):

To scan for any and all objects defects and any and all physical damages. I
addition large
stand up scanners, we could have hand held devices (mobile versions).

W could use it to scan the brain, examine the body for disease, (illness),
physical injuries,
perhaps integrate the device with a 360 degree (insertable) body or pipe any
and all probes.
Used examine the structural integrity (eg. cracks and uneven layers, improper
placement) for
any and all construction and infrastructure and buildings, roads...any and all
structural
support (examining the perfection of cable tensioning)...

Pipes, and/or water/liquid tanks that all need to be leak proof. Also to find
leaks in roofs and
as well where the leaks in tunnels are coming from.

Used for shipyards any and all boats, air planes, space shuttle (mini
version).
Insurance views of internal damage to cars.

The correct precision of cuts on diamonds, jewels, and the observable of
impurities (and
even provide certification for good quality diamonds). Also industrial diamond
bits, tungsten
carbide, even tires for imperfections.

Examining containers holding hazardous waste (checking for leaks) from toxic
chemicals to
nuclear.

Given the need to speed and amount of bandwidth for New Internet Multi-
Dimensional web
browsing...



We are considering building a selective quantum teleport network.

1. First we identify the all largest domains (with the most active Users) that
are in close
proximity to each other.
2. Then we use quantum teleportation technology to send instant communications
large
domain(s) to large domains(s).
3. Then, between cities and differing sets of large domains from region to
region we
create a back bone/superhighway between the sets of large domains.
4. These high performance networks could auction their highspeed bandwidth to
the
highest bidder per time period. Therefore Users with less time sensitive uses
could
opt for lower cost alternate network pathway. Possibly with a intelligent
logistics
manager that identifies network nodes that that have excess bandwidth.
5. Performance demand can be set by the User, depending on use. One way is: 1.
red
light (slowest), 2. amber light (medium speed), and 3. green light (high
speed).
6. Green light can have right of way along the back bone/superhighway and they
would
pay a higher price.

To create an information superhighway, internet high speed backbone (in
addition to travel
distance limits) of teleportation technologies.

This invention will maintain the integrity of the representation of the binary
and/or other
language reading pattern/sequence entered in the backend of the highway and
produce the
same reading (patterns) results at the other end of the final receiving
node(s).

First we entangle a number of atoms, the number of atoms needed depends on the
distance
before the entangled atoms lose their (clear readability;
examinable/observability) legibility
and ability to interact correctly with the photons and the number this
distance limit of
quantum teleportation divides into the total distance from the source/origin
location, the final
receiving location (depending on distance that will be required until atom's
state becomes
degraded beyond stability and unable to correctly recalibration), all with the
atoms are
entangled with the same state. Then we send place the entangled atoms in
separate fibers,
with the first and second fibers travelling as far a clear/stable state (and
at that distance is
recalibrated ~ their states recalibrated/re-entangled at that distance/point ~
recalibration/re-
entanglement involves multiple comparison of states overlaid to create a
clearer picture), at
the next recalibration/re-entanglement (the third distance at the point of
loss of quality of
creaity/state) point the third fiber passes bypasses the first two check
points is
recalibrated/re-entangled at this check point overlaid to clearify the states.

We could also try to identify the parts that deteriorate in relation to timing
and distance eg.
degraded losing momentum and integrity (constant pattern and/or rate of change
of pattern)
of orbit pattern (of electron or proton... ). Degradation between different
nodes (changes
and/or rate of changes as distances), which features (states) are more lasting
and easy to
extrapolate and also performance of different equipment.

We could also make Multiple Screen Rooms where Users can interact with the
computer
screens (standing and/or sitting ~ eg. swivel chairs), and in the back of the
room there could
be a sundeck/balcony, that is raised (eg. like wood deck/floor - with a an
optional brick stove,
to have barbeques or just lounge while enjoying the view (all 4 sides of room
and ceiling),
and/or also interaction with the computer, using laser pointers to move
pictures and titles (eg.
representative labels) running Gerard Voon's patented Logical Language...and
each User
could have their own key board, and their own mouse identity (eg. the board
game monopoly



pieces: car, train...-also differing colours for each piece. We could even
rent internet cafes
and corporate collaborative offices with this technology.

We could also use use mobile memory cards to use memory as a recording device
(to
replace the Dictaphone), to save chapters of sortable (eg. date/time; label;
level of
importance; size) recorded and convertible to/from VOIP computer files...this
device can be
plug and play compatible with Black berry, itunes, cellular phone, digital
camera, PDA (eg.
palm pilot and other such mobile and (lap top/desk top/back pack computer)
computer
compatible devices). Perhaps all fitting safely in a padded brief case and/or
back pack
and/or pouch, with hand traps for singular usage. They could also use the same
battery
source in the brief case/back pack...

Our multidimensional Internet version homepage can be a waiting room (with as
secretary
(Artificial Intelligence or tech support), to direct the browsers' interests;
to meet their
needs...or to experts that can help them. We could even have all browsers
using a main
portal that has a Mega Memory Model covering organization of the grand scheme
of
knowledge that intuitive mimics human memory. The experts each has their own
office and
departments, and different sub portals can be for different uses (packaged by
interest). The
User can have option to his (eg. business website internet protocol website
buttons) to
access from any and all places anywhere on any website (where depending on the
standard
format each room and even main entities/interactions have different content on
their internet
protocol website buttons).

The Browser can shake hands with The secretary (Artificial Intelligence/Call
Centre
Techie/Secretary) which will screen and qualify people to speed the knowledge
process and
save the website owner's company time, 1. There are customers; 2. there are
Media; 3. there
are Level to Level of Executives ~ for appropriate engagement protocols (eg.
position, size of
company, income range); 4. there are site map of Departments; 5. there are
vertical and
horizontal chain outsourcing buyers/suppliers/sellers ~ multidimensional
displays and
interactive products; 6. there are potential Investors ~ suit their interests
in topics, subtopics
the organization's strengths and weaknesses, opportunities the company is
poised to benefit
from (the potential risks) and management biographies; 7. there are Owners of
technologies
who are interested in Mergers and Acquisitions.

In additions to visual (multidimensional objects/entities/interactions), the
browser can ask for
anything (with the Artificial Intelligence that, depending on versions has
levels and areas of
expertise)... If the Artificial Intelligence trained expertise can't answer
the Users questions 1.
The AI can look up the topic and research using memory models (process of
elimination
where in a more and more specific belonging where the answer lies, how to
solve, calculate,
value, creating new algorithms, and evaluate non-numerical criterias, and even
data mine) to
probe the Users knowledge and qualify what the User (what is the most probable

clue/attribute given the information already confirmed (or already measured
highly probable ~
list) about the answer's identity that we can check ranked by order that will
add most
significant confirmation of that answer, 2. if a field of expertise is not
identifyable then direct
the User to a Artificial Intelligence that has broader scope of expertise, 3.
finally if neither
Artificial Intelligence or the browser opts any time for can go directly to a
call tech support
centre. The Artificial Intelligence can at the behest of the User send the
criterias that the
client has mentioned that they are looking for; what avenues of memory model
and search
engines have been tried, all to the techie call centre...



The Artificial Intelligence can quick read and organize document information
for the User to
save time and effort and even package large documents for delivery over the
internet eg.
email (and/or attachment), download/upload...

1. It singles out/identifies key words (ranking and delivering by dependence
the
keywords - words that define for whom the level of understanding will be
appropriate
to identify the subtopics covered for each topic and that the message most
relies on
to get across the (points GP)) (and possibly summary important points which
organization the User decides) such as entities/objects, interactions, quality
and
quantity which are ranked by information chunks and sent first as a preview of
the
place in the grand scheme of knowledge download then listing the key words
ranked
by importance scale (eg. number from 1 to 10), create a link between this word
and
other related words by memory model and/or the same word used elsewhere in
other
places in the document or related documents (and the level of importance
sought that
the other key words usage eg. 1 to 10). Then ranks them by the dependency the
message is on each word per sentence and chunks of related sentences, and
strings
of sentences that are woven from separate sentences not necessarily
consecutive,
yet are related to make the a theme/broader concept understandable and/or they

might just be other aspects of two related key words expounding another area
that
the words can be used in. Judging the keywords can be memory model ~

also the Artificial Intelligence could emote the same way.

Additionally neural links (and Artificial Intelligence that creates these

(and enjoying
the breaks - appreciating), turning channels on the television, change in
sleeping patterns,
change in tasks, change in motivations, divergence in compartments of life.

Not just change but routines/in a person's cyclical lifestyle, eg. having tea
(as a daily routine)
and/or coffee, and/or taking a hot shower to de-stress for those who can't
afford a masseuse,
basically therapeutic routines that satisfy/completes a person's daily
expectations (quality



personal time), and leaves behind unwanted thoughts and takes away their
ability to taint the
experience (which empowers and refreshes (GP) /recoups for the rest of the
day's activities)
like an escape from the parts of reality that are disliked. Another way is to
watch movies.
Movies can be an escape of segmented episodes that cover the passage of time
(of multiple
unresolved) time - compressed (key events or key turning points in the story,
the opener/ the
challenges/the experience created and/or recreated episode by episode gives
the experience
of growing up with the character, and when watching the movie again the
patient could note
new positive things in the movie that he never noticed before or the Al could
bring up such
things.

We could also line our hat/helmet electrodes receiver/transmitter above with a
layer of noise
canceller so the amplifier will pick up and send neural messages free from
interference (GV
GP).

We could use such products prototype development products such as MicroLux
High-
Precision Heavy-Duty Miniature Milling Machine or their competitors eg.:

.cndot. Super rigid, heat-treated cast-iron base, column and headstock with
precision-ground
V-ways.

.cndot. Hardened and accurately finished main spindle supported by high
precision
centripetal roller bearings.

.cndot. .050 inch per turn table feed screws with zero-resettable dials.
.cndot. Hi-low gearbox for torque amplification at low speed.

.cndot. Powerful adjustable-speed motor with fan-cooled feedback-sensing power
boost
circuitry.

.cndot. Tilting column for angle milling/drilling.

.cndot. Lever-actuated spring-assisted headstock performs drilling operations
with ease.

3. Milling Machines could be used to create scale models of multidimensional
objects/entities that a web browser encounters on multidimensional websites
that the
website owner does not lock out (eg. for patent/copyright/trademark and
proprietary
reasons).

4. Milling Machines' models that are not directly translated into
multidimensional
object/entities could be recreated via pins measurer/recorder into and then
animated
multidimensional objects/entities in the multidimensional websites.

Further model/prototyping for designing between multidimensional website

manufacturing tools. Software programs include SolidWorks, SurfaceWorks, other
solid and
surface modelers such as ProEngineer, Alias/Wavefront, and Maya, and
MasterCAM, a
leading, CNC machining program.

We could develop a database of types of objects, what their moving parts are when the move (eg. limbs), such as tires on a car and/or any and all moving parts within any and all objects...For example humans, the with regard to regular movements of walking/running/jumping and the bending torso movements (in rhythm with button abilities to speed up and/or slow down). 1.) the hinges can and tips of body parts mimicked in a real human template to generate a repertoire of movements of any and all objects. And/or illustrated - eg. comics are used to create templates of repetitive movements. The regular same proportionately of movements such as hands that whereby they reach out by the elbows unfurling with or without making a move with or without weapons, carrying an object any and all things and/or picking up things (the speed of pickup). The human body and the movement of their legs as they. Movements can be controlled by video games controls and/or Wii - eg. complex movements such as golf swing/hand to hand combat techniques can include/involve timed sequence of directions-joystick with moving pressure possibly in a circular direction (more than one click of more than on button). We could also use existing frame by frame computer animation. We could also have (template) straight appendages/limbs that attached sequentially from the extremities to the central body torso. Between further extreme appendages/limbs (eg. shins) and closer to the central body torso (eg. thighs), double clicking on the appendages/limbs (as recognized body parts of humans and the type of regular (movement between the appendages/limbs that are moved during and how the timing (speed/acceleration), direction and amount of distance of the movement - swinging/pivoting like on hinges that is the body's joints) the technique for lifting the front foot up and forward and in collaborative/coordination as such parts of the bodies should move or design with customized animation or gait of a model with recordable body points. To make the experience even more interesting perhaps a vibrational technology could be used, for example where there is a pad and the (even with Artificial Intelligence) different buttons on the pad vibrate (and the strength of the vibration) and light up possibly with an emotion icon on the screen as a chosen response to the Users' actions...

Units can be sold for home use and retail boutiques (fashion) - for exact fitting look. The pin art unit(s) measure all the body's measurement (which are recorded on computer and/or Artificial Intelligence) and are sent to the internet where 1.) a tailor can recommend based on use and fashion (casual versus conservative), 2.) the buyer picks the clothing (combinations) and it is tried either by Artificial Intelligence or by a sales clerk manually puts clothes on a mannequin with the same body, 3.) the buyer uses or describes possibly via video conference the colours (GP)/styles/sizes of the various components (the cut) of the clothing/material. There could be an optional secondary (probably smaller) pins shape measurer/recorder with smaller/finer pins to sense/get more definition; more detail. The buyer can call up (various options) of any and all environments/scenarios for retail fashion stores to try out clothing such as walking in the beach, formal/casual/semi-casual events. Pins shape measurers/recorders can be used for any and all products (such as electronics, appliances, furniture any and all products where dimensions are important) eg. itunes, PDA, texting, Movies Library, Back Pack Computer, cellular, lap top, whereby the Buyer zooms out to see (the product relative to human size character/player handling the in scenarios, such as the sky train station, of President's Suite of a hotel.

Then the User can either use generically anatomically correct colourings (also customized clothings - fit by Artificial Intelligence) and/or submit the body measurements/recordings to the fashion boutique sales clerk will put the clothing on a mannequin of similar body proportions - maybe even have mannequin body parts that are interchangeable (eg. clothing of a human object that are anatomically fitting) or possibly take a photograph of the human wearing the clothing from all four sides. Like Virtual Reality, important objects can be seen from any angle 360 degree (especially interesting eye catching objects that generate interest (given topic) translated into hits - or to separate from competition or highlight competencies), the User could even have the (eg. possibly mouse knob) to spin a selected object around 360 degrees (analogue view of object). And/or cheaper and faster speed to switch (or pre-programmed) for 4 sides front/back; side to side (symmetry/reflection) depending how far you are from one face to the perpendicular face.

2618645,NEW INVENTION FOR INTERNET MODEL VENUE,25.08.2009,"We start off this invention with a new James Bond movie. Part of the charm of James Bond movies is that life styles of the rich and notorious; and each movie has different and exotic locales. In the movie Bond is with his internet saavy girlfriend when she notes there is something strange happening in the Second Life (or similar Virtual World Platform perhaps our own creation eg. Next To Life), Bond follows the chase trail to a call centre in India where 3 hijacking techies have broken in to the Second Life Management (security database) using Artificial Intelligence. He follows the trail to Japan teleport city where he climbs on to the roof and fight it out. It turns out the culprits behind this ruse are a multiracial, Intercontinental hacking syndicate (called The Allegiance). The Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform comes with direct neural link (that can come with Artificial Intelligence to help sort and analyze information as an Aid and also help filter secrets). The neural link has an internal component - understanding via simulation (of scenarios and circumstances) and/or key words, Logical Language and/or memory models, representative words/symbols... and weighing to make a decision which option to choose - which is behind the scenes not observable by anyone else on the Next To Life VR Platform; and an external component to execute physically/verbally acting out the decisions. There can be a micro screen or partition of the screens Both the internal and external neural thought links can have a list of choices (drop down menu), there are 3 methods to navigate the menus, (first starting in the middle) Method 1. moving up or down each choice one by one, or Method 2. half-way splitting - which involves starting in the middle half-way distance then either choosing moving half-way up or down between the middle half-way distance to the half-way between the very top or the very bottom, by splitting the distance half-way between the top and the bottom, eventually you home in on the place or your desired choice to arrive at. Or Method 3. if your choice is near the top or the bottom you can take the top option and move directly to the top or the bottom and then use navigation method 1 move down or up one choice by the next choice. The Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform incorporates: 1. 3 to 4 screens (using Logic Language, systems/parts, memory models, representative words/symbols/attributes/clues/linkages/relationships). 2. Possible 3-D and IMAX (joint locale experience). 3. Neural Networks, where thoughts can be connected directly to other minds for the ultimate closeness experience, or can be filtered by dividing thoughts into an internal and external component. So the Professional Hacking Syndicate use Artificial Intelligences' to break into and using high speed (gold orbs) instead of persona's - the orbs move faster and suck in all the electronic trail behind it. By hacking into the secure database (which appears as a bank for each country), they obtain identity theft of which they use to make fake buy's and sells of items under the stolen identity's credit/debit cards. They break into the Virtual Reality House of the elected President of Next To Life and steal all his high level security codes and use Artfficial Intelligence to block him from using his computer by infecting his computer with a network of mainframes Artificial Intelligence changing coding that is nearly impossible to crack. James Bond is enters the Next to Life system with the help of his girlfriend who has written a character/persona that is a silver liquid shape shifter (like the orbs) form that are capable of high speed. When he follows the orbs into the Smithsonian Institute he meets two twin chicks (one is an Artificial Intelligence plant and the other is a college girl that is experimenting), the Artificial Intelligence makes them appear as twins. They both sleep with him in the 5 star Hawaiian Hotel a place in the Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform for conjugal visits neural intimacy. The girls are designed by the Hackers because they have heard about James Bond's weaknesses. The Hackers get the lead, in the Smithsonian Institute he retraces his steps and to speed up he takes on the form of a pilot in a transforming robot - Avro Arrow to chase the orbs (Q has given him glasses that sees streams of translucent wavy trail where removal of an electronic trail has left behind). The gold orbs take on the form of Black Mech Droids Jets, they battle the USA forces which come in Blue/White/Red Mech Droids Jets. The Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform could have an X-Box Portal and Play Station (2) Portal for Video Gamers to jointly play video games that are available over the internet via Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform. We could create a Large Scale/Big Box Tech support (helping clients find what their problems are) and helps them order parts (eg. hardware), what they need for installation level of difficulty to install whether its worth buying the installation tools, eg. installing upgrade to RAM. We could have the world's largest selection of electronic parts, selling tech parts, service upgrading, buy, sell and trade used parts certified pool of workers. We could supply these wide range of tech goods and services over the Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform. We could tie with the computer company (sorting by part) eg. monitor versus printer, noting their integratebility/sustainability, by brand name and model number. Eventually we could even start our own brand name for our own audio/video and tech goods. We would like to create a Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform version of the Smithsonian Institute using pictures/prints/faux copies. We also plan to have a Hall of Fame for Celebrities; scientists and humanitarians (selling mementos, cards and signed pictures). We could also have a Business Hall of Fame. People can buy cards (like Hockey Cards), of companies, cards of Vice Presidents of Different Departments - their Stats: age; years in the firm; metrics measuring their success for that year - CEO's Presidents, Chairmen and even the Bottom (lowest position). Stats of the business include % of the market, estimated size of the market (reason for market share captured in excess or below expectations eg. supply and/or demand factors), Classification of business, major competitors, Picture of Exec's Educations, titles, Philanthropy, belong to what associations... We could create an investment/investor matching service centre in the Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform (option for fair trade) especially for the poor worldwide. Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform can join with NYSE, NASDAQ TMX and LSE, members receive a hat or badge, on their computer screen they press button to show real time ticker tapes. Investors (members) could trade via robot and/or video conference on the trading floor via streaming real time bid/asks, posting shares of bid/ask on video screen for the brokers to see. Investors are alerted when a new release from one of their invested companies' is expected, what the forecast is (metrics), and recommendations on what to do if it is above or below expectations. They receive analyst recommendations in real time. Buys, sells, which stock companies, industry, sector economy, the best way to play the trends and events. There is a database taken from articles in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters, Dow Jones and Bloomberg that picks out (say in the last week) company names (or symbols) especially those that have high volatility and/or volume also ranked and sorted by % rise and % fall. And overall long term steady upward trend. We could sell advertising in the form of Bill Boards (eg. on building walls or along streets); LED Boards; Posters; Banners; Neon signs - all of which the user can print. Erecting street signs on building walls outside and inside. These signs could have say 3 or 4 layers, by pressing a button, you switch from one picture to the next and/or backward. We could also create a consumer Ratings of Latest High Tech Roll Outs of New Products (new innovations and why it is better than current technology and whether it is worth the increased cost). Judgement criteria - usages that the new product can be applied; in areas of professional, home, friends, to what part of life of whom it caters the most benefits; listing what the new products does (functions: new, old, utility in what areas of life...) of which creates more versus benefits that different people may be looking for. We plan to create a shopping mall for high end brand names (with streets similar to Rodeo Drive, with Boutique Hotel lounges and Virtual Reality Rooms, where only those allowed through the lockable portals can have conjugal visits. We want the most trendy Brand Names. We could hold fashion shows with invitations for real and Virtual Reality seats and after show video sales.

2618651,QUANTUM COMPUTING H/W AND S/W AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,25.08.2009,"Quantum Computers hard ware as well as soft ware and/or Artificial
Intelligence (via node
network and project manager/primary coordinator) where:

Running multiple simulations to solve the same type of problem at the same

different inputs and formulas (0.15%), or the same type of inputs variables

attempting all
options/decisions/strategies (strategies involve multiple options and ability
to roughly guess
the future scenarios correctly some of the time) at the same time (similar to
Gerard's
Mathematical Language) - operations/tries.

Where the final product that choice of formula will produce (result in) can be
extrapolated.
Best foresight/forecasting (led to believed best decision/option/strategy

best of which include major drivers that (least non-renewable resources
required that
produces the most impactful to results), balancing major variable and their
relationships, and
/or overview - collective of all factors and their contributions from start
time to end time of
final product.

In the case of Artificial Intelligence, multiple inputs are run through with
Logic Language
systems that bond entities and interactions together via
attributes/clues/connections/linkages
(of which multiple attribute/clues...can be searched at the same time) eg.
stimulus (rules
(values - emotion that can be becoming and changing in response as time passes
and
spontaneity for humans can add an element of unpredictability) - interactions -
response,
action - reaction to find sought output, and other outputs speculated and/or
accidentally
discovered (negative and/or positive) running multiple simulations by varying
type, amount
and timing of inputs.

A systems inclusive parts that contribute to impact effects on the conditions
of outputs,
operations which are interactions (how the system or segment of system) works
its proper
behaviours, input and the action/reactions (and catalyst where these inputs
usually aren't
necessary as ingredient of the output character but are needed to facilitate
the conversion of
inputs into desirable output form).

The mechanics of relevant interactions type, amount of gain versus unwanted

usage don't belief needed; believed unimportant; can't see the value in any
important usage;
doubt its usefulness)

One use of Quantum computing monitor huge number of genes in any and all gene
related
diseases and/or solutions/treatments:

Such as Monitoring all the genes that have become deactivated/activated
(timing - to
suggest cause effect) such as when a batch of stem cells have stepped
dividing. And then
test each or combination (as well as sequencing - when along the division
process become
deactivated/activated) all genes simultaneously.

peaks over the time span) - taking into account profit taking,
corrections/event driven and/or
timing) pushes the stock price up and when the major investors sell the price
goes down;
whereby if the investors are rational a company that has good fundamentals -
sustainable
competitive advantage should appreciate over the long term....

Video Games/Artificial Intelligence - cascading (huge parts of games and
alternative
evolution of characters and outcomes - manmade and natural, changing society;
changing
backdrops) changing resources, changing objects - change based on choices in
game by
Users. What happens based on (values and emotions; strategies logically and

characters in the
environments. What happened when other characters (run by Artificial
Intelligence) reacts to
the way the User (eg. while the User is away); incentives; positive various
carrots and sticks;
fears; quality time (Je 0.01%); give/take; assets; affections; supportive of
their insecurities
(uncertainty); competitive by other characters how they treat the Artificial
Intelligence
characters, the Artificial Intelligence characters might learn to do without
you while you are
gone (learn to live independently) - from the compartment that the eg. object
character
chooses to dwell in. Incentives - negative; fight; argue; judge harshly;
(versus making
allies); agree to join against common enemy; (also glory; promises for a
group, crowds and
populations behaviours).

Artificial Intelligence (eg. Office soft ware, computer programming, algorithm
programming;
h/w, s/w tech support) can be rentable such as multiple Artificial
Intelligences' that are
running simultaneously and can even be self-directed; or the Artificial
Intelligence can walk
people through operating (inputs - interactions - outputs) any and all
automated mechanical
things even mind to body any and all things that can be controlled.

We could also use quantum computing for our Multiple Level Mag Lev Vechicle
logistics and
also Sky Highway and/or airport to airplane landing and lift off logistics.

In all the above cases we could put labels/representative word with a
combination of
numbers and alphabets (that dedicate a section to a systems' theme - similar
to libraries
Dewey Decimal Call Number) on each alternative especially landmarks
choices/options
labels mark system then entities (inputs/outputs)/interactions/time screnarios
and
quantities/qualities, organizing related system (whose parts have a close
bond/attribute/clues/connections/linkages/relationships... - can be chosen and
valued by
strength and lasting (usually non-volatile) intervals/cycles of volatility
temporary strengths
versus steady, growing major factors that affect the strength of the
relationship versus past
factors that either by one side of the relationship or the other side has less

effects/impacts) as well as cycle spanning this type of relationship to
influence and become
impactful - also dependent on sensitivity of each side (supply/demand) and the
amount of
resources needed and allocated to make usually correlated (cause/effect)
changing size of
impacts) of choices by the same number/alphabet system label (section). We
could also use
SUDOC Call Number, ISBN/ISSN, OCLC...where User wants to save memory space,
than
can just include landmark representative system labels/names/key words (eg.
Medicine -
treatments) ... that riff off internet browsers and on the Users own only
include the specifics of
the system's part(s) information they want quick access to (possibly because
of expected
repeated use) eg. short term memory.



My Logical Language and Artificial Intelligence creation uses a similar
system. Different
sections/chapters (of memory) are dedicated to different forms of human mind
processes.
Therefore the left hand (large side) digits section/chapter digits (indicators
of macro
size/place) tells the User the process that occupies that place, how the
process works
operations; the right hand (small side) digits (micro specific digits)
dedicate memory to
contents: inputs - interactions - outputs. So a programmer who wants to deal
with a certain
mental process can go straight the section/process call number dedicated to
that process.
Communications, chit chatting, content important (eg. identifying, important
data, news,
message, beliefs qualifying/quantifying...
Create an algorithm about emotions (responses), of the (can classify people
eg. aggressive,
assertive, passive, passive - aggressive) regular people's reactions to
stimulus, taking into
account types of new experiences, tendencies, current moods, context, types of
events that
have occurred over what time spans between multiple events that cause regular
people to
reframe/change perspective. Quantum Computing can be used to constantly update
extrapolated changes in values and (given place and time...and other
attributes/linkages/connections/clues - can update this too) that identify the
character of the
stimulus and/or response (possibly packaged upgrade over the internet - for
values;
stimulus, response to duplicate personas of celebrities) and how the
Artificial Intelligence
perceives the stimulus and how it measures up to our expectations/enough that
we believe
we hope for. And our appetite which are generally driven by these factors.

Using entity, interactions, quality, quantity, theory, stories ...
interchangeabality below
Another way to awaken the memory is to recognize a clue/attribute/key word and
their
characteristics/linked/connected that goes with, known to be related to entity
you are looking
for (such as the looking back at the sought after's entity's features - known
surroundings,
- parts of system that are bonded together by
theme/subject/attribute/related...; what you
remember and what you felt/liked/disliked (usually in response to features)
degrees by clue
entity towards sought after entity and the system in inhabits or parts within
the sought after
entity. This response feelings might possibly be matched via known features of
the sought
after entity and then matched with time frame(s) and place(s) and usage(s) -
the major usual
anchors of identity via experience of person's encounter with a past entity -
at first glance,
then other attributes/clues...

Social interactions depends scenarios (the parts - eg. objects (as well as
conceptual
content) that are the source of stimulus) the values that the person possesses
determine
sensitivity - amount of impact - the yield of the ability of the stimulus to
effect us 1) passion
(love - want best for person; hate want bad for the person), 2) indifference
(no appetite) and
3) curiosity (interest) ... Most people develop repertoires of responses that
generally govern
normal behaviour - eg. office repertoires, home repertoires, socializing
repertoires, versus
letting loose and just having fun over weekends, or acting irrationally such
as rebelling
against those who tell you what to do. (Ch 0.01%).

Artificial Intelligence Many Simultaneous Complex Boolean Searches eg.
choosing the best
eloquent word (and/or substitute answers) for expression:

The list of grouping that include/possess/ownership plus range of quantity a
feature -- attribute that links to other entities/interactions/systems/parts
via attributes/representative
words/labels/titles/clues/linkages/connections (quality - direct composition
of parts of an



entity - interactions (system))/ keywords to understanding and representing
the entity
- system (titles/labels/popularity linked keywords linked to popularity and
summary).

(anything) that help (relevant) identifies (usually usage driven since people
only have interest
in searching for something that they want to use (purpose) for something),
features and/or
attributes/clues/linkages/connections of other entities/interactions that
cater to usage or
would highly probable to be found definitively singly uniquely to identifying
the wanted
features of entity/interactions that best satisfies usage (and fit especially
where unique
requirements require specific quantities/qualities and/or entity
nouns/pronouns
names/titles/labels represent usage that keeps (possess) the wanted meaning to
a specific
level of detail - to home in on more than one word used to define/describe);
plus given
alternate meanings that lingo has picked up as alternate and often similar
meaning as the
sought after definition for usage of word. What functions/usages/aspects that
a word in
question include in meaning that have cannot be included and therefore rules
out use of this
word. This is the process of elimination, except where the substitute words
are close in
meaning - word express unique properties, correct usage among like words
(application of
doing/interactions, versus identities/entities or multiple complex
relationships called
systems), look for the absolute perfect fit (versus many close substitutes,
where certain
qualities or unwanted qualities are expressed by one and/or combinations of
high demand
unique/niche supply) has been known to exist tracked back to usage of similar
encountered
in the past. How is the current answer/word (versus substitute) demand on
expression/experience to describe/define the sought after target answer (or
chunk/systems/pictures/scenarios; entities/interactions of meaning represented
by words)
are important enough in demand between the differences (between substitute -
features) and
How is supply (of each answer/word) able to include all the wanted meaning and
also
exclude critical meanings.
Definition in the case where there are no substitute words we can develop
algorithms - that
update themselves and/or an algorithm designing program to update other
algorithm -
analogies - models, by representing parts with labels (where the object is
intangible), the
behaviours of each part grouped together - usually by function as a segment of
overall
operations of the system, stimulus response (lasting and consistency) - life
has an element
of randomness (especially with people's thoughts). The analogy - model
represents the
answer, what it does, physical parts as well as beliefs (relationships such as
cause - effects,
business decisions based on event/expected impacts; scientific hypothesis -
theories; story
telling - movies for entertainment value experience.

In story telling some insights on Lord of the Rings. The Hobbits weren't just
kids or young
adults, they were boisterous and like to tell tall tales, and their bodies
were different shaped
even their strut were different from adolescents. Furthermore each
character/fellow in
Fellowship of the Rings, has pivotal points like their fate was to fulfill a
testing point(s); the
audience wonders, will they rise up to the challenge when the time(s) come.
What they
contribute to their shared problems (gain/loss) make more different/easier.

We could also rent memory and processing software sharing the huge power of
quantum

2621058,NEXT TO LIFE VERSION II,22.08.2009,"We start off this invention with a new James Bond movie. Part of the charm of
James Bond
movies is that life styles of the rich and notorious; and each movie has
different and exotic
locales. In the movie Bond is with his internet saavy girlfriend when she
notes there is
something strange happening in the Second Life (or similar Virtual World
Platform perhaps
our own creation eg. Next To Life), Bond follows the chase trail to a call
centre in India where
3 hijacking techies have broken in to the Second Life Management (security
database) using
Artificial Intelligence. He follows the trail to Japan teleport city where he
climbs on to the roof
and fight it out. It turns out the culprits behind this ruse are a
multiracial, Intercontinental
hacking syndicate (called The Allegiance). The Next To Life Virtual Reality
Platform comes
with direct neural link (that can come with Artificial Intelligence to help
sort and analyze
information as an Aid and also help filter secrets). The neural link has an
internal component
- understanding via simulation (of scenarios and circumstances) and/or key
words, Logical
Language and/or memory models, representative words/symbols... and weighing to
make a
decision which option to choose - which is behind the scenes not observable by
anyone else
on the Next To Life VR Platform; and an external component to execute
physically/verbally
acting out the decisions. There can be a micro screen or partition of the
screens

Both the internal and external neural thought links can have a list of choices
(drop down
menu), there are 3 methods to navigate the menus, (first starting in the
middle) Method 1.
moving up or down each choice one by one, or Method 2. half-way splitting -
which involves
starting in the middle half-way distance then either choosing moving half-way
up or down
between the middle half-way distance to the half-way between the very top or
the very
bottom, by splitting the distance half-way between the top and the bottom,
eventually you
home in on the place or your desired choice to arrive at. Or Method 3. if your
choice is near
the top or the bottom you can take the top option and move directly to the top
or the bottom
and then use navigation method 1 move down or up one choice by the next
choice.

The Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform incorporates:

1. 3 to 4 screens (using Logic Language, systems/parts, memory models,
representative words/symbols/attributes/clues/linkages/relationships).
2. Possible 3-D and IMAX (joint locale experience).
3. Neural Networks, where thoughts can be connected directly to other minds
for the
ultimate closeness experience, or can be filtered by dividing thoughts into an

internal and external component.

So the Professional Hacking Syndicate use Artificial Intelligences' to break
into and using
high speed (gold orbs) instead of persona's - the orbs move faster and suck in
all the
electronic trail behind it.

By hacking into the secure database (which appears as a bank for each
country), they obtain
identity theft of which they use to make fake buy's and sells of items under
the stolen
identity's credit/debit cards.

They break into the Virtual Reality House of the elected President of Next To
Life and steal
all his high level security codes and use Artificial Intelligence to block him
from using his
computer by infecting his computer with a network of mainframes Artificial
Intelligence
changing coding that is nearly impossible to crack.



James Bond is enters the Next to Life system with the help of his girlfriend
who has written a
character/persona that is a silver liquid shape shifter (like the orbs) form
that are capable of
high speed.

When he follows the orbs into the Smithsonian Institute he meets two twin
chicks (one is an
Artificial Intelligence plant and the other is a college girl that is
experimenting), the Artificial
Intelligence makes them appear as twins. They both sleep with him in the 5
star Hawaiian
Hotel a place in the Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform for conjugal visits
neural intimacy.
The girls are designed by the Hackers because they have heard about James
Bond's
weaknesses. The Hackers get the lead, in the Smithsonian Institute he retraces
his steps
and to speed up he takes on the form of a pilot in a transforming robot - Avro
Arrow to chase
the orbs (Q has given him glasses that sees streams of translucent wavy trail
where removal
of an electronic trail has left behind). The gold orbs take on the form of
Black Mech Droids
Jets, they battle the USA forces which come in Blue/White/Red Mech Droids
Jets.

The Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform could have an X-Box Portal and Play
Station (2)
Portal for Video Gamers to jointly play video games that are available over
the internet via
Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform.

We could create a Large Scale/Big Box Tech support (helping clients find what
their
problems are) and helps them order parts (eg. hardware), what they need for
installation
level of difficulty to install whether its worth buying the installation
tools, eg. installing upgrade
to RAM. We could have the world's largest selection of electronic parts,
selling tech parts,
service upgrading, buy, sell and trade used parts certified pool of workers.
We could supply
these wide range of tech goods and services over the Next To Life Virtual
Reality Platform.
We could tie with the computer company (sorting by part) eg. monitor versus
printer, noting
their integratebility/sustainability, by brand name and model number.
Eventually we could
even start our own brand name for our own audio/video and tech goods.

We would like to create a Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform version of the
Smithsonian
Institute using pictures/prints/faux copies. We also plan to have a Hall of
Fame for
Celebrities; scientists and humanitarians (selling mementos, cards and signed
pictures). We
could also have a Business Hall of Fame. People can buy cards (like Hockey
Cards), of
companies, cards of Vice Presidents of Different Departments - their Stats:
age; years in the
firm; metrics measuring their success for that year - CEO's Presidents,
Chairmen and even
the Bottom (lowest position). Stats of the business include % of the market,
estimated size
of the market (reason for market share captured in excess or below
expectations eg. supply
and/or demand factors), Classification of business, major competitors, Picture
of Exec's
Educations, titles, Philanthropy, belong to what associations...

We could create an investment/investor matching service centre in the Next To
Life Virtual
Reality Platform (option for fair trade) especially for the poor worldwide.

Next To Life Virtual Reality Platform can join with NYSE, NASDAQ TMX and LSE,
members
receive a hat or badge, on their computer screen they press button to show
real time ticker
tapes.

Investors (members) could trade via robot and/or video conference on the
trading floor via
streaming real time bid/asks, posting shares of bid/ask on video screen for
the brokers to
see.



Investors are alerted when a new release from one of their invested companies'
is expected,
what the forecast is (metrics), and recommendations on what to do if it is
above or below
expectations.

They receive analyst recommendations in real time. Buys, sells, which stock
companies,
industry, sector economy, the best way to play the trends and events.

There is a database taken from articles in the Wall Street Journal, Reuters,
Dow Jones and
Bloomberg that picks out (say in the last week) company names (or symbols)
especially
those that have high volatility and/or volume also ranked and sorted by % rise
and % fall.
And overall long term steady upward trend.

We could sell advertising in the form of Bill Boards (eg. on building walls or
along streets);
LED Boards; Posters; Banners; Neon signs - all of which the user can print.

Erecting street signs on building walls outside and inside.

These signs could have say 3 or 4 layers, by pressing a button, you switch
from one picture
to the next and/or backward.

We could also create a consumer Ratings of Latest High Tech Roll Outs of New
Products
(new innovations and why it is better than current technology and whether it
is worth the
increased cost). Judgement criteria - usages that the new product can be
applied; in areas
of professional, home, friends, to what part of life of whom it caters the
most benefits; listing
what the new products does (functions: new, old, utility in what areas of
life...) of which
creates more versus benefits that different people may be looking for.

We plan to create a shopping mall for high end brand names (with streets
similar to Rodeo
Drive, with Boutique Hotel lounges and Virtual Reality Rooms, where only those
allowed
through the lockable portals can have conjugal visits. We want the most trendy
Brand
Names. We could hold fashion shows with invitations for real and Virtual
Reality seats and
after show video sales.

We plan to design the grounds and services and products of tourists
(attraction sites) -
throughout the world, we could hire a robot carrying a camera, to move through
museums,
art galleries... and offer extensive gift shops. Share leisure places to visit
eg. cruise ships...
We could have sports, new release movies (Movies Library) and other public
events (like
closed circuit television). People at different nodes (different locations
meeting on the
internet) could communicate as they watch the same or even different movies,
via micro
screen video conferencing and/or text at bottom of screen.

Sharing of hobbies:

1. Horticulturists - throughout the world can offer live or previously taped
video taped
rare coveted or beautiful plants, including pictures of plants in bloom, (sale
of seeds)
tending needs - even genetically engineered plants; arrangements; landscaping.
2. Bird watching - pictures of rare or very beautiful birds, where they were
taken and
when, video tape of bird sanctuaries, live or previously taped.
3. Model Building - fantasy, space, movies (when was movie released), -
historical, cars,
soldiers, planes, ships. Sets for sale via Next To Life purchase.



4. Adopt/sponsor an orphan and/or poor, homeless and/or sick (dying eg. last
wish),
picture is available previous to donation, then video clip and video
conferencing
available. Also with stray pets and animal sanctuary...
5. Full Working University. Classes are by neural node network, unless video
conferencing classes are opted for:

teaching
(possibly with Artificial Intelligence as well) there could be video taped

may need to be updated as time passes) and video conferencing classes as well
as
written and/or DVD textbooks, notes...

We could tie up each character/persona with face book like profile (eg. Name
Age,
interests) and pictures, basically exposure of personal real information about
the
person/character/persona (changeable/updateable) where depending on the person
(eg.
pressing a button to see the information about the person/character/persona
they are
meeting and/or interested about (eg. possible index), there would be different
levels of
security access as to the level of personal/intimate information available for
different
people who want to view and get to know via such information.

We could also map out Las Vegas (GP 1%), the White House, Yellow Stone
Park...Any
and all places that people would like to visit. Also we could have a forum
that allows
Users (to share with fellow Users eg. commentary and/or text line at the

2608174,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS,30.04.2009,"We plan to grow algae, bamboo, sugar cane and corn to make ethanol. The sugar cane will be shredded and its liquids squeezed out for ethanol. The remaining fibers will be shredded and cut to an optimal length for agricultural use. Sugar is a form of fertilizer. These fibers will be cooked in manure tea (stirred even blended to instil fertilizing potency - wider blend of nutrients) and rolled and squeezed and cooked in manure tea (stirred even blended to instil fertilizing potency - wider blend of nutrients) rolled and squeezed (depending on whether the results of such a process - high quality organic fertilizer are worthwhile). The fertilizer can even be pelletized. The tea manure as well as the powdered sugar cane can be used to grow algae. The algae could be bagged with transparent bags and solar panels underneath the bags could further make the most use of the site by both producing energy; Solar panel energy and algae converted into ethanol. A self brewed medium for algae includes Glucose, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4, NH4Cl, NaCl,MgSO4, CaCl2... The sugar cane fibers as well as the corn shredded husks can also be used to make soil substrate (GP 0.05%) as well as biodegradable seeding and trans planting and all planting pots, biodegradable packaging, bags, imitation cardboard, pulp and paper, envelopes, books, treated with preservatives and mixed with adhesive and compressed to produce a form of gypsum; fiber board, faux wood cabinetry, door, frames, posts, exterior finishing, all construction usage, including wood floors, wood ceilings, roofing, shutters, closet doors, faux wood furniture 2%, all housing, all office, all real estate, all condominiums, all sky scrappers, all apartments, all wood finishings, all shelves, (all decorations 5%), all wood decks, all gazebos, all wood structures, all sheds, all extra wood structures (eg. pool house or tree house), The powdered sugar cane fiber and powdered corn husks can be mixed with resin; As well as the 3-dimensional modeling printer, we could also build plastic/resin (perhaps mixed with particle/gypsum board) or glues/adhesives structures. We are the first to make and sell the following novel products because they are to be developed using mix with nano particles or nano fibres or biodegradable substances such as shredded and powdered corn husks) possibly sprayed or spun/woven and) create strong/durable and yet flexible (if need be) and light weight products (where the addition of nano material or the 3 - dimensional model creator can be used to make a better product - or at least a niche).

2601603,MULTI STORY/LEVEL MAGNETIC LEVITATION VEHICULAR (JETSONS') SYSTEM,11.03.2009,"Our Mag Lev expandable multilevel system for all uses from city to in-between cities.... Where there are ramps and/or elevators to change levels or enter garages at the same level that has an entrance/ext at that level or go down to the road below to park or enter a garage. 1. Is the overhanging (from above or below the magnetic levitation vehicles) support possibly made of tungsten steel carbide, titanium and magnetic track that it supports (possibly crisscross lattice such as the tall structures of construction cranes -- although traditional concrete with tension cables could be used - we like crane lattices because it allows sunlight to shine on the street and pavement below; furthermore the crane lattice supports that the Mag Lev vehicle track uses, its back end maybe lodged (space carved or mutually supported) - attached or the side of the building with an encasement of concrete at its base. 2. Concrete blocks or encasement in buried concrete that gives reinforcing support from the lower levels. 3. Additional, expanding supports to upper (tracks) levels that can be wrapped/entwined with steel cables for mutual support furthermore we could make the shape of the supports vertically slide in slots that are vertically height oriented where possibly two of (or more than 2) sides depending on number level slides into each other's male and female holsters.. 4. The magnetic tracks, possibly two going lanes on each side. 5. Support may have to be cut into some surrounding buildings where the buildings are to close to the street leaving no room for the support 6. Direction of that side of the tracks. We could even build in vertical supports that rise from in-between the roads below, wherever feasible or necessary. We could build futuristic multiple story/level magnetic levitation tracks for magnetic levitation vehicles could glide to alleviate traffic congestion and increase density, for the most productive use of land and saving urban sprawl from destroying our agricultural and wild life preserve. There could be traffic functions, such as four way alternation stop, and turning lights... And intervals along the road are situated fast magnetic elevators (and possibly mixed with actuator or pneumatic or winch elevators). These elevators could be integrated with a far right lane allowing drivers to get into the right lane and exit into the elevator to change stories/levels and then use a far right lane or to merge back into the road. Changing stories/lanes could also be done with ramps (GP 10%). Changing stories/levels could also be done via overpass - built between one or more stories/levels (as well as changing direction). Trucks and buses could use the ground level/ underground and/or the first story/level which's strength could be reinforced the most. Finally the entire logistics could be controlled via Artificial Intelligence or computer algorithms, so human passengers no longer need to drive they simply instruct the Al/computer of their destination (GPS or track monitoring place/speed of vehicles and where there is access space; where a vehicle is sped up by Al/computer and thus creates space for other cars to speed up behind; where there is a bottleneck the Al/computer could compute if time can be saved by taking an alternate route - perhaps change story/level that has faster traffic. We could even create multiple lanes (magnetic levitation tracks) highway with multiple stories/levels. The vehicles could be made of aluminium. Instead of magnetic levitation we could use the cheaper monorail tracks (GP 10%) of multiple stories/levels and separate vehicles made of aluminium; so the tracks don't need as much reinforcement and therefore needs less space (current monorail tracks are an eyesore and take up so much space for one simple story/floor of tracks). We could also make vehicles that both function as rubber tire vehicles (for the street on the concrete story/floors below) and switch back and forth to alternative functioned vehicles that use the monorails tracks midway above and/or magnetic levitation tracks higher up (GP 10 %). We could also create carriers of chains of standardized cargo containers that have a skeleton hooking the cargo containers (made of aluminium skin with carbon fibre cage or fibre glass walls) chain at points along the chain that run along the monorail or magnetic levitation or which can be separate from the trucking streets on the ground and underground floor below, another option is to assign a whole story/level to cargo chains (for delivery between ports and warehouses...). We are considering Gravity Chain Machine elevators. Additionally we could magnetize the bumpers surrounding the vehicles to avoid accidents. Additionally we could magnetize the bumpers surrounding the vehicles to avoid accidents, or add some sort of sensors (we could sell this technology to all car companies) that depending on distance and acceleration and speed of the a car nearing another car (possibly microchips on all four corners of the cars) slams on the brake strategically in a rhythm that maximize wheel to grip time.",CA,B60L 13/00,https://www.wipo.int/ipcpub/?symbol=B60L0013000000&menulang=en&lang=en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
